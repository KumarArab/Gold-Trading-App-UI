Today we'll be converting an another dribbble inspiration into a real coded app. Our today's 
inspiration is a Gold Trading App UI by Ghani Pradita. Thank you so much for creating such an awesome #UI.
This UI contains two screens grouped in a bottom navigation bar. Second screen is what excited me to make 
this UI. This screen contains a beautiful Bezier chart which can be easily implemented using a flutter package.
Check out the video to see how easy it is to make such beautiful charts in Flutter.
